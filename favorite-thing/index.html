    <h1>Math</h1>
    <p>My favorite subject in school is definitely math. Math is extremely valuable in all aspects of life whether it be calculating lengths, economics, growth and decay of a virus, and even finding the most Chicken McNuggets that connot be bought using
        9 and 20 pack Chicken McNuggets. I also love math because of the satisfaction of solving a particularily clever problem. You look at a problem for a few seconds, stumped at what method could be used to solve it, then suddenly, Eureka!!! The solution
        had to be found in the Chicken McNugget theorem!!! You eagerly jot down your ideas on paper until finally your math clicks together likes pieces in a puzzle.</p>
    <h2>Math in School</h2>
    <p>Math in school is exciting because you can constanly discover new theorems every class. It's like adding a new library to a script, suddenly you have the ability to do new things you could never do before. New math topics can also be used to expand
        your knowledge on other topics on your own. Finding the area of a circle is quite simple, base times height. While this is simple at first, how do calculate the area of a triangle? This seems much different at first, but soon one can see how the
        rectangle split in two from corner to corner is simply a triangle. Suddenly a new world of ideas is opened up, with the pythagorean theorem or trigonometry, allowing you to see how the math in theorems are derived.</p>
    <h2>Math in Competition</h2>
    <p>Math in competition is vastly different from math taught in schools, but its fun in its own way. Competition math allows you to look deeper into topics probably not valued in normal school curriculum like the chicken McNugget theorem or how colliding
        blocks compute pi. with new insights you can see the world in new ways, each time you buy some Chicken McNuggets you can formulate the largest number af nuggets that you can't buy, providing another interesting faucet in a matter as trivial as
        buying Chicken McNuggets. Math competitions also can add a spice to math that school topics cannot ignite. Competing with your fellow peers is incredibly fun and although it can be frustrating when you lose, it just encourages you to do better
        next time.</p>
