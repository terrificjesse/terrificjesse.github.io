    <h1>My FLow</h1>
    <p>I enter flow state when I am reading books because I am often able to focus solely on the book instead of other things.</p>
    <p>I am sometimes not able to enter flow state when reading a book because I am not able to get settled in on the book and get distracted by other things, especially loud noises and other flamboyant activities that keep my attention away from the book</p>
